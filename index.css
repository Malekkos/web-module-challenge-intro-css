/* IMPORTANT -------- DO NOT USE PX, just rem's or em. Ill determine what i want the root file to be, but until then, no pixels. */

/* main text body = #DDV9A3, goes in html? */
/* back of footer is #f9e7dc */
/* in the third body div, certain text needs bolding. Use font-weight: bold; */
/* imperative that all of the content utilizes box model properties, eg. content, padding, margin and border. ALL OF IT. We want the web page to match the design file.
The image in header is round, we should use border-radius: 50%;
Round corners on nav's and NOT footer items, we have the navs in a seperate div. We should, however, look to making the font... whatever the hell that is? The font im talking about is the one applied to 'Yosemite Park Guide'
*/
/* We should be able to make our 2 classes 'inliner' display: inline-block; to make them stand next to eachother */
/* Screen should be long so that the navs have a point, should be the last thing checked. */
/* need to remember how the a link stuff works, its blanking me */
/* also, remove the added stuff like the line and the color blue, might happen automatically tho */


/* STRETCH GOALS */
/* We can try the animation stuff. */
/* not really sure about the 'design your own pages' bit, may just not do it. Well, i know what its asking for. not sure how to link to another website or page of the website tho */
/* god only knows what a favicon is */
/* i probably could host it, ill check at the end. */
